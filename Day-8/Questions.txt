Write a program to find the number of distinct elements in an unsorted array. [Do it without sorting the array]


Input Input:

Input consists of n+1 integers. 

The first integer corresponds to n, the number of elements in the array. 

The next n integers correspond to the elements in the array. 

Assume that the maximum value of n is 15.

 

Output Format:

Output consists of a single integer which corresponds to the number of distinct elements in the array.

 

Sample Input:

5
