Q4)USECASE
Grandfather Raman was a wealthy man who owned fertile agricultural land.
He worked hard all his life to grow crops and maintain the land.
When he grew old, the property was passed on to his son Suresh.
Suresh expanded the land by building a beautiful farmhouse.
He also planted fruit orchards, making the land more valuable.
Years later, Suresh handed over the property to his son Arjun.
Arjun, being tech-savvy, built a modern villa on the land.
He also installed solar panels to make the property eco-friendly.
This way, each generation added something valuable to the inheritance.
The familyâ€™s legacy continued to grow through three generations.
