Abstraction:-
it is a process of hiding the internal implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.
it focusses on what an object does not how it does it.
it is achieved by using abstract classes and interfaces in java.
it helps in reducing complexity and increases code reusability and security.
abstract keyword is used to define a class / object.

Q1) Write a java program and print the values using a abstraction.

Q2) Write a java program and print the values using a Interface.

Q3)Description
In a bank, customers only interact with simple services like depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking balance. They don’t need to know the internal process of how the bank stores the money, updates databases, or manages transactions.
Initial Balance is 5000

Here, abstraction is used. The bank provides an abstract class Bank with abstract methods like deposit(), withdraw(), and checkBalance(). Different banks like SBI or HDFC implement these methods in their own way, but for the customer, the interface remains the same.

This hides the complex implementation details from the user and only shows the essential functionalities.

Input Format
First line: Bank name (e.g., SBI)
Second line: Operation (e.g., deposit or withdraw)
Third line: Amount

Output Format
Display the result of the operation with the updated balance.

Test Case 1
Input:
deposit
2000

Output:
Deposited: 2000
Current Balance: 7000

Test Case 2
Input:
withdraw
6000

Q4)Description
In the stock market, investors focus only on buying and selling shares.
They don’t see the complex backend where trades are matched and recorded.
For them, the platform simply shows actions like Buy, Sell, and Check Portfolio.
This is abstraction — hiding how the system works, showing only what is needed.
Different exchanges like NSE or BSE implement these actions in their own way.
One may charge extra brokerage, while another may offer discounts.
Yet, for the investor, the interface remains the same: buy, sell, and check.
Thus, abstraction makes the stock market simple and user-friendly despite its complexity.

Input Format
First line → Action (buy or sell)
Second line → Company name (e.g., TCS)
Third line → Quantity of shares

Output Format
Show the result of the action (Bought/Sold shares).
Show the updated total portfolio shares.

Test Case 1
Input:
buy
INFOSYS
40


Output:
Bought 40 shares of INFOSYS via NSE.
Total Shares in Portfolio: 40

Test Case 2
Input:
sell
INFOSYS
20


Output:
Sold 20 shares of INFOSYS via NSE.
Total Shares in Portfolio: 20
